Vehicle Routing Algorithm using Nearest Neighbor
Time Complexity:
- Nearest Neighbor Algorithm: O(n^2) where n is the number of customer locations.
- Writing Delivery Routes: O(n) where n is the number of customer locations.
- Calculating Total Distance: O(n) where n is the number of customer locations.
Space Complexity:
- Nearest Neighbor Algorithm: O(n^2) for storing the distance matrix.
- Output Dataset: O(n) for storing the delivery routes.
- Total Distance File: O(1) for storing a single value.
WE ARE SUBMITTING TWO CSV FILES FOR ROUTE DISTANCE TRAVELLED PLEASE REFER TO BOTH OF THEM
